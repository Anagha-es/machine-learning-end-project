# 🚘 Car Price Prediction in the US Market

This project uses machine learning to help a Chinese automobile company analyze and predict car prices in the US market. It explores key variables that influence price, evaluates multiple regression models, and identifies the best-performing one.

## 📌 Business Goal
To build a model that predicts car prices based on various features and provides insights into the pricing dynamics of the US market.

## 📊 Models Used
- Linear Regression
